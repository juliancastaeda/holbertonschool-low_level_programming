A function is a group of statements that together perform a task. Every C program has at least one function, which is main(), and all the mos\
t trivial programs can define additional functions.

You can divide up your code into separate functions. How you divide up your code among different functions is up to you, but logically the di\
vision is such that each function performs a specific task.

A function declaration tells the compiler about a function's name, return type, and parameters. A function definition provides the actual bod\
y of the function.

The C standard library provides numerous built-in functions that your program can call. For example, strcat() to concatenate two strings, mem\
cpy() to copy one memory location to another location, and many more functions.

A function can also be referred as a method or a sub-routine or a procedure, etc.
